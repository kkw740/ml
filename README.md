Here’s a brief overview for each question to prepare for your oral exam:

### 1. Data Preprocessing on Heart Dataset
- **Data Cleaning**: Remove duplicates and correct any inconsistent data formats.
- **Handling Missing Data**: Use techniques like mean, median imputation, or remove rows/columns if missing data is significant.
- **Data Transformation**: Scale features (StandardScaler, MinMaxScaler) and encode categorical variables.
- **Train-Test Split**: Split data with 75% for training and 25% for testing, often using `train_test_split` in Python’s `sklearn.model_selection`.

### 2. Confusion Matrix for COVID Test Scenario
- **Confusion Matrix Setup**: TP = 45, FP = 55, FN = 5, TN = 395.
- **Metrics**:
  - **Accuracy**: `(TP + TN) / Total`
  - **Precision**: `TP / (TP + FP)`
  - **Recall**: `TP / (TP + FN)`
  - **F1 Score**: `2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)`

### 3. Regression with Temperature Dataset
- **Linear Regression**: Use libraries like `sklearn.linear_model` to fit the model.
- **Metrics**: Use Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-Square for performance.
- **Visualization**: Plot predictions against actual data to visualize the regression.

### 4. Classification with Graduate Admissions Dataset
- **Preprocessing**: Encode categorical variables, such as `Research` and `Admitted`.
- **Modeling**: Use Decision Tree for classification.
- **Evaluation**: Assess accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant metrics.

### 5. Spam Filtering with Naive Bayes Classifier
- **Preprocessing**: Convert labels, perform text processing (e.g., remove stop words).
- **Modeling**: Use Naive Bayes classifier for spam filtering, comparing results with another classifier (e.g., SVM).
- **Evaluation**: Use cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning to improve performance.

### 6. Clustering on Customer Dataset
- **Clustering Algorithms**: K-means and Hierarchical Clustering can identify customer segments.
- **Train-Test Split**: Though often unnecessary for clustering, the data could be split to check for consistency in clusters.
- **Analysis**: Check for distinct groups based on Spending Score.

### 7. Association Rule Learning with Market Basket Data
- **Generate Transactions**: Format the dataset for association rule mining.
- **Apriori Algorithm**: Apply the Apriori algorithm to find frequent itemsets.
- **Visualization**: Show item associations with a confidence threshold.

### 8. Neural Network for Li-ion Battery Dataset
- **Model Setup**: Design a simple ANN with a few hidden layers using frameworks like Keras or TensorFlow.
- **Evaluation**: Use metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix for the classification of battery crystal systems.
